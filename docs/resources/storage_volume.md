<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `project_id` (Number) The ID of the Project which this Storage Volume should be in.
- `specs` (Attributes List) List of specs (SKUs) for the Storage Volume drive. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--specs))

### Optional

- `instance_id` (Number) Required if type is "hyperv".

The ID of a Compute Instance with the type "hyperv" the Storage Volume is to be mounted to.
- `name` (String) The user-friendly name for the Storage Volume type. If not sent and the type is "cephfs", it will default
to the name 'Ceph'. If not sent and the type is "hyperv", it will default to the name 'Storage HyperV'.
- `type` (String) The type of Storage Volume to create. Valid options are:
- "cephfs"
  A Ceph file system volume which can be mounted to one or more Compute Instances of the type "lxd"
- "hyperv"
  A volume which can be mounted as a secondary drive to a Compute Instance of the type "hyperv"

### Read-Only

- `contra_instances` (Attributes List) A list of Compute Instances the Storage Volume is mounted to. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--contra_instances))
- `created` (String) Timestamp, in ISO format, of when the Storage Volume was created.
- `id` (Number) The ID of the Storage Volume record
- `instance` (Attributes) The "hyperv" Compute Instance the "hyperv" Storage Volume is attached to. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--instance))
- `metadata` (Attributes) The metadata object of "ceph" Storage Volumes (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))
- `state` (String) The current state of the Storage Volume
- `updated` (String) Timestamp, in ISO format, of when the Storage Volume was last updated.
- `uri` (String) URL that can be used to run methods in the API associated with the Storage Volumes instance.
